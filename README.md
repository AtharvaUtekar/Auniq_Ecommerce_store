## Introduction

This is a fully functional eCommerce web application using commerce.js.

While building it learnt many advanced React & JavaScript topics, as well as how to use Stripe for card transactions. I have also intergrated Commerce.js, for backend and to provide the actual feel of an e-commerce web store!
